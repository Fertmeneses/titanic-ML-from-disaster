# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

Hi there! Welcome to a **deep study** for the *Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster* competition, hosted by **Kaggle**. You can find my original competition notebook in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fertmeneses/titanic-kaggle-full-analysis)üëàüèΩ.

Here, you will find the story, told in simple terms, of how I've used **feature engineering**, **data edition** and **Machine Learning techniques** to train an algorithm that can predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on many indicators such as their age, title and the fare they paid.

The progamming code is written in Python language, including well-known libraries like **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **sklearn** and **xgboost**.

The Titanic started its voyage in Southampton (UK) on 10 April 1912, made stops in Cherbourg (France), Queenstown (nowadays Cobh, Ireland) and then sailed to New York (US). Unfortunately, the ship never reached its destination but sank in the Atlantic ocean on 15 April 1912, after colliding with in iceberg.

The collision with the iceberg ocurred around 23:40, with most of the passengers already gone to bed, and the evacuation was carried out in a very disorganized way, with unequal treatment of passengers from different classes. The 20 lifeboats carried by the ship could only accomodate 1,178 people, out of the 2,224 passenger and crew. The vessel RMS Carpathia arrived about 2 hours after the sinking, rescuing all survivors at that time.
